# CloveShuffler
CloveShuffler is an addon for Anki that can shuffle your Clove answers/lines in your flashcards. This is to stop you from simply memorizing the position or order of the answers.

# DISCLAIMER
This addon is in it's very early stages of development and release. It is entirely functional and usable in it's current state, however there are certain risks you take when using it. Nothing bad has happened yet in my testing, but you have been warned.
